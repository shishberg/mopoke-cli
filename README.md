# Mopoke command line

Mopoke is (or will be) a task management system, mainly aimed at individual or family to-do lists but with the eventual idea that it could be used to run, for example, a kanban board.

This repo is a command line interface that talks directly to the database. It was the first hacked together piece of Mopoke but will at some point be superseded by the API server https://github.com/shishberg/mopoke-api (and replaced by something that uses the API).
